# FTP-server-Project
This is the project that was assigned in my csc 311 Networking class. The goal was to create a successful file server which connects two computers together via sockets and allows for there to be an ftp server waiting for a connection and an ftp client who is connecting to the server. This project was done in python using the python socket library. In order for you to get this to work you must have the server program being run on a separtate computer with an ethernet connecting the other computer which is running the client. The client will then be able to navigate through the filesystem on the server computer and select a file to download.
